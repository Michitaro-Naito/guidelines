# Working Guidelines

If you are going to work with us, please follow these instructions.


## Beginning of Work

### Estimate Anything

When you are asked to do something, please estimate and let us know how long it will take.
(Even if you are not asked to do so.)

good:
```
We: "Could you implement this?"
You: "Sure. It will take 4-6 hours. It will be done tomorrow because I have another work today."
```

bad:
```
We: "Could you implement this?"
You: "Sure."
// We might misunderstand that you can implement it immediately. :(
```

### Think Best and Offer

Time is finite so that we can't specify everything sometimes.
If detailed specifications are not enough, think best before you ask.

good:
```
We: "Could you implement this?"
You: "Sure. We can use Foo-Library or Bar-Library. Can I use Foo-Library because it's faster?"
```

bad:
```
We: "Could you implement this?"
You: "Sure. But how can I do?"
```

### Ask if Essential

If you have a problem which seems essential, please ask us.

good:
```
You: "Design-A is much faster but sacrifices scalability. Can I adopt it?"
We: "No, you can't. Are there any other solutions?"
```
bad:
```
You: (Design-A is much faster but sacrifices scalability. I don't care. Let's adopt...)
// Scalability is essential sometimes. We receive useless program and you wastes your time. Oh, no... :(
```

## While Working

### Tell us if you are going to be late

If you are not on schedule, please tell us.
We can avoid the worst situation if you could tell us before it's too late.

good:
```
You: "Hey, I said it will be done tomorrow though, it seems it will take a few more days."
We: "OK. I was planning to meet clients tomorrow though, I'm going to schedule it a bit later."
```
bad:
```
You: "Hey, I said it will be done yesterday though, it seems it will take a few more days."
We: "What!? I told my clients that it can be done JUST IN TIME and they are about to COME to see ME!"
// Please don't throw a feeble creature like me into the hell... :(
```
