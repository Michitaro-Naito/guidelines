# Working Guidelines

If you are going to work with us, please follow these instructions.


## Beginning of Work

### Show the Flag

Make it clear yes or no, understood or not.
Please remember that just saying "OK" saves time.

good:
```
We: "Could you implement this?"
You: "Sorry but no. I'm not sure that I can do it in time."
```
bad:
```
We: "Could you implement this?"
You: "Hmm, it's a good day. It seems complex but not impossible."
// We might misunderstand that you are going take a part of it.
```
very bad:
```
We: "Could you implement this?"
You: (Read but replys nothing.)
// We will wait for a while and lose time.
```


### Estimate Anything

When you are asked to do something, please estimate and let us know how long it will take.
(Even if you are not asked to do so.)

good:
```
We: "Could you implement this?"
You: "Sure. It will take 4-6 hours. It will be done tomorrow because I have another work today."
```

bad:
```
We: "Could you implement this?"
You: "Sure."
// We might misunderstand that you can implement it immediately.
```

### Tell us if you need more

If you need more payments, tell us. We agree not always. But we will never ban anybody who tell us to raise his earnings because we know that anybody want to earn more and we love such guys.

But never pad your working-time nor costs.
We think that's cheating, preventing cooperation and should be banned.


### Never envy the others

Alice earns x10 higher than Bob sometimes.
Bob should never envy her success.
Because unfair earnings between cooperators might be a fault of Amlitek, but not hers.


### Think Best and Offer

Time is finite so that we can't specify everything sometimes.
If detailed specifications are not enough, think best before you ask.

good:
```
We: "Could you implement this?"
You: "Sure. We can use Foo-Library or Bar-Library. Can I use Foo-Library because it's faster?"
```

bad:
```
We: "Could you implement this?"
You: "Sure. But how can I do?"
```

### Ask if Essential

If you have a problem which seems essential, please ask us.

good:
```
You: "Design-A is much faster but sacrifices scalability. Can I adopt it?"
We: "No, you can't. Are there any other solutions?"
```
bad:
```
You: (Design-A is much faster but sacrifices scalability. I don't care. Let's adopt...)
// Scalability is essential sometimes. We receive useless program and you wastes your time. Oh, no... :(
```

## While Working

### Share Information

Development is Teamwork.
Share information to let your cooperators work smoothly.

good:
```
You: "I'm going to change the database. Apply this SQL to yours."
Mate: "OK. I will."
```
bad:
```
Mate: "Hey, it's not working. It seems you have pushed something wrong."
You: "Nothing wrong. I have just changed the database."
Mate: "Tell me if you do. You have wasted my hours!"
// This might trigger war between Mate and you... We would like to live in peace. ;)
```


### Tell us if you are going to be late

If you are not on schedule, please tell us.
We can avoid the worst situation if you could tell us before it's too late.

good:
```
You: "Hey, I said it will be done tomorrow though, it seems it will take a few more days."
We: "OK. I was planning to meet clients tomorrow though, I'm going to schedule it a bit later."
```
bad:
```
You: "Hey, I said it will be done yesterday though, it seems it will take a few more days."
We: "What!? I told my clients that it can be done JUST IN TIME and they are about to COME to see ME!"
// Please don't throw a feeble creature like me into the hell... :(
```

### Take a Nap if Sleepy

You might feel sleepy when you are tired from your works.
We can't pay for time you sleep though, it's all right to take a nap to keep your performance.
Please forgive us if we interrupt your napping-time. ;)


## Ending of Work

### Give us a time-sheet if you are hired

If you are hired, please send us a time-sheet which describes when, how long and for what you worked weekly.

good:
```
You: "I have worked 140 minutes to implement Foo on Monday and 50 minutes to implement Bar on Wednesday."
We: "Yeah, thanks. I'm glad to pay!"
```
bad:
```
You: "I have worked about 5 hours and did something."
We: "I thought it was about 3 hours though? I'm going to pay but it's over."
```
